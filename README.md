# About Me
<p>
Taulani Salt is an RMIT Creative Writing student and fiction writer from the Mornington Peninsula. Her seaside hometown is often a source of inspiration in her writing, as well as her interests in history, fashion and medicine. When she's not writing sweeping historical romances or working on assignments, she can be found lounging on her hometown beach, brewing her fifth cup of tea for the day, or waiting tables at her local whiskey bar.

Lani currently has [one publication](https://bowenstreetpress.com/salt-her-dress) with RMIT's own Bowen St. Press.
