# About Me
<p>
Lani Salt is an RMIT Creative Writing student and fiction writer from the Mornington Peninsula. When she's not drafting historical romance novels or working on her latest Uni assignment, she can be found lounging on her hometown beach, brewing her fifth cup of tea for the day, or waiting tables at her local whiskey bar.  Just like her, her stories are full of sentiment, warmth, and a hint of country charm. Her writing involves a lot of vibe curating on Pinterest and Spotify before any writing begins, then she'll unleash it all onto a blank document in 10-20 minute increments until it resembles something close to a first draft. Currently unpublished, she hopes to one day become a novelist, (that is, if she doesn't accidentally re-write 'Gone With the Wind'...again.)
