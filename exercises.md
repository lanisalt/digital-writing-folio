# Exercises
## Week 1 - Hello world!
### Digital writing
<p>
Coding has always messed with my brain in the same way that maths always has, so I'm going into this class with an open mind, ready to embrace what I'm sure will be a learning curve. Luckily, as a writer, language is what my entire field is built around. I've been taught to adapt it and work with it, bend it to my will as a tangible way to express my thoughts. Coding is nothing more than another medium to for me to play and experiment with, so i'm excited to see where my creativity will lead me. I figured that the digital world is always evolving, so my practice should, too. 
This week, we discussed the basics of Electronic Literature (or E-lit) and its three generations. The first generatiom (mostly hypertext) and ended in 1995 as the internet continued to expand, allowing for multi-modal E-Lit, (encluding pictures, audio, video, etc,) defining the second generation. Today, in the third generation, pretty much everything is digital, so the lines between games, e-lit and social media posts are a lot more blurred. I wonder when and if they'll ever be a fourth generation - What will make it distinct from the third?

### My writing
#### What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
<p>
 I'm a fiction writer, primarily. I don't like writing nonfiction as much (I find it quite boring), and poetry is a challenge for me. I tend to gravitate towards historical fiction and romance, mostly, usually with lots of descriptive elements and dramatic settings.
</p>

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
 Word mostly, but also the pomodoro method and a [self-destructive writing tool](https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app/write?limit=15&type=minutes) I found online that deletes your progress if you stop writing for more than 5 seconds. I also like to map out what I write with planning documents, playlists and pinterest boards - i'm a very visual person and like to create a clear image in my head before I write. I also like to get comfy and listen to music.

#### Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
<p>
 Typically to force myself to get stuff down and inspire me to write. I love writing, but getting myself to do it is always the hardest part. Sometimes if I lose interest or don't stay on top of it, I'll leave projects abandoned.
</p>

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)
 <p>
 My methods sound very constraining, but I actually find them liberating - they help me break out of mental blocks and stop me from obsessively editing my work as I go, which is something that I've always struggled with in the past. I also find the excessive planning enjoyable as well as helpful; I get to be creative with moodboards and playlists!

## Week 2: Coding playground
[My coding playground](https://github.com/lanisalt/coding-playground)

<p>
This week, we began coding in Glitch - I was correct in assuming that it would be a learning curve. For the coding playground we're working on, a lot of the content we included was stuff that we had already written. I decided to theme my coding playground around Taylor Swift's 2019 album 'Lover', as It started to feel a lot like a personal anthology of mundane, ordinary expressions of my own experiences with different types of love (romantic, family, personal, etc.) through notes app entries, search history and messages. I liked this concept a lot, but executing it in a new medium was tricky and hard to wrap my head around at first. Eventually, however, I managed to smooth out the syntax errors and difficulties I was having, and it coding slowly became a little less intimidating the more I got used to the language and learnt to navigate the lines of code. My favourite part of this exercise was the Google search option, as I was able to sneak in some easter eggs about my interests, the things I love, etc. In a really straightforward, but also hidden way. 
</p>


# Week 3: Digital poetry
[My dadaist poem remix](https://github.com/lanisalt/lanis-dadaist-poem)

<p>
Poetry, (like digital writing, i've found,) is hard to define. I always thought of poetry as short but complex pieces of text that really take a lot of effort to read and even more effort to write. Sometimes poems rhyme, other times they have a certain amount of syllables in each line, and sometimes they're just <br/>
 ramblings <br/>
 split up into <br/>
  line breaks <br/>
  so they seem a lot more deep <br/>
  than they actually are <br>
(looking at you, rupi kaur) <br/>
<p>
It was under my impression that the defining factor of a poem would just be the intention behind it - if you write it as a poem, its a poem. So when we learnt about dadaist poems this week, I was confused about what made them poetry. There's a little bit of intention, but there isn't much writing involved at all, as the point is to take something that already exists and make something new out of it. I naturally supposed that meant that the poetic element of it wasn't the writing itself, then, it was the method behind a dadaist poem - meiticulously cutting an article or piece of writing up, shaking them and laying them out to make it your own - that makes it poetic. What confused me, though, was whether copy-pasting a piece of text into a box and clicking a button counted as the same thing, as it takes a lot less effort and dedication than the traditional method. (Turns out this is actually on brand when you look at the anti-art roots of dadaism. it's a double dada, if you will.) Eventually I came to the conclusion that, duh (da), the whole point was that you can still create poetry and find meaning in nonsense without any skill or formal training. It's quite literally the modern art of poetry, (with my personal preferences towards their more traditonal counterparts to boot.) <br/>
I'm still a bit iffy about coding at this point - it's still pretty overwhelming to me, and have found it frustrating to find my footing in this new medium, even with the coding playground exercise. However, it's all part of the learning process, and I have enjoyed the interactive aspects. I mentioned before that the exercises and readings have made coding a little less intimidating to me, but it's also helped me see E-lit as a medium, just like poetry and screenwriting, and, of course as a fiction writer, I'm not going to be immediately good at it, as much as that annoys my perfectionist brain.

### Algorithm & constraint
#### What is an algorithm? What is a constraint?
An algorithim is a sequence designed to solve a problem. A constraint is a limitation or rule that restricts something. In writing constraints can be word limits, stylistic rules, etc.
#### Can you think of ways you might already be using these in your writing? (e.g., tools, techniques or processes that constrain and sytematise the way you write)?
Outlining plot points or arguments in an analytical essay, writing prompts, writing routines (writing x amount of words a day, writing at a certain time of day, etc.), time and word limits (eg. pomodoro, self destructive writing tool)

#### Why were the Oupilo writers so interested in the intersection of maths and literature?
They took inspiration from that structures and constraints, believing they could spark creativity. They used formulas, patterns, and logic to invent new ways of writing and found that constraints can help you write instead of stifle it. (eg. Georges Perec’s novel 'La Disparition' is written entirely without the letter 'e')

#### How does algorthmic writing make us think differently about authorship?
 It challenges the idea of writing being written entirely by the author. If a piece uses an algorithm, who is the true author - the person who wrote the words or the system putting them together?
 
#### Dadaist poem I generated using an extract of my own writing:

 #### Lipogram attempt (without using the letter 'E')
 
 <p>
With only 26 units in our ABCs, cutting out just a small part of it jacks up how difficult it is to say what you want to say. Writing without our most common non-consonant thus shows how writing with limitations is a skill that most must polish up on continually. 
<p/>



# Week 4: Experimenting with Twine
[My first twine experiment](https://github.com/lanisalt/twine-test)

<p>
We were introduced to Twine today, which I like a lot more than Glitch and Github. (Until this point I've been avoiding github, writing my weekly reflections in OneNote so I can just put it into my repository later, but I've decided that I'm now brave enough to step out of my comfort zone and type here instead.) 
</p>

<p>
I found that I enjoyed using Twine's interface much more than Glitch and Github, as some of the coding reminds me of Discord chat shortcuts and Minecraft commands, which both have syntaxes that were easy enough for me to memorise back in my 'gamer girl' phase of 2020-2022. It's also a lot less intimidating than straight javascript, with the little boxes helping visualise what elements the different parts of code work with what, and how they connect to eachother and work together. I might look into working with twine for my final assignment, as the typertext I have been studying for my presentation next week was written in the same program. Funnily enough, the hardest part of this activity for me was uploading my work to my Github repository, (which does not surprise me. I've had constant beef with this website since day one.) It took teacher assistance and about 9 of my previously healthy brain cells, but we got there in the end. I just need to figure out how to get my images to show up, and we're set.
</p>

# Week 5:
### what is emerging for you in your own piece toward assignments 2 & 3?
I know that I'd like to write something personal - I really liked the personal aspects of my coding playground (including text messages, notes app notes, etc.) and I think I might do something that involves that, since I don't do a lot of personal writing. Maybe a poetry/prose anthology. I also like the idea of writing a classic linear hypertext, like a choose-your-own adventure story a la the Famous Five book my parents read to my sister and I growing up.

### What platform & tech does it require?
I'm thinking Twine - it's been the easiest to use for me so far and I like the hypertext format, which was what the piece I did for my presentation, 'c ya laterrrr' used. I could maybe do a puzzle, or some kind of virtual escape room. I don't really want to use Glitch or Github, as much fun as that was... 

### Can you make it?
I think so. I'll have to look more into what Twine can do, but the premise seems achievable enough. I don't want to do anything too crazy and bite off more than I can chew - I want it to stay simple so I can focus on developing my skills, rather than creating something super profound and stressing myself out.

### What else do you need to learn? 
More of the basics on coding, definitely -  How to link multiple twine passages to the same passage, how to add images properly so that they actually work (lol), how to change the CSS, etc.
</p>

# Week 6: Twine pt. 2

[My image map test](https://github.com/lanisalt/image-map-test)

<p>
We worked on image styling, audio and image maps this week. My favourite part was the image map, specifically, which I think i'll be using as the main component of my final project.
</p>

# Week 8: Author Website
[My author website](https://github.com/lanisalt/author-website)

<p>
Making an author website was a really useful skill to learn - in this industry, you very much have to rely on yourself to promote your work and create connections with other writers, editors, potential clients, etc. which i've come to realise more as I get closer to finishing this course, (we are under the media and communications school, after all!) Luckily, with social media it has become a lot easier to make these connections, and having a website means your work and contact info is right there is a bonus in case anyone wants to access it. I would like to put my work somewhere easily accessible on the internet, so I tried to include links to some of my work that I've published on Portfolium, as well as some cute picture-book-like drawings i've done over the years just for fun. It's not fully functional yet, but I have enough basics down to know how to create my own website, which is super cool and a valueable skill to have, considering how much it normally costs to have someone make and operate a website for you , (speaking from experience, with my dad once working as a freelance graphic/web designer and my mum in marketing.)
