# Week 1: Hello World!
<p>
Coding has always messed with my brain in the same way that maths always has, so I'm going into this class with an open mind, ready to embrace what I'm sure will be a learning curve. Luckily, as a writer, language is what my entire field is built around. I've been taught to adapt it and work with it, bend it to my will as a tangible way to express my thoughts. Coding is nothing more than another medium to for me to play and experiment with, so i'm excited to see where my creativity will lead me. I figured that the digital world is always evolving, so my practice should, too. 
This week, we discussed the basics of Electronic Literature (or E-lit) and its three generations. The first generatiom (mostly hypertext) and ended in 1995 as the internet continued to expand, allowing for multi-modal E-Lit, (encluding pictures, audio, video, etc,) defining the second generation. Today, in the third generation, pretty much everything is digital, so the lines between games, e-lit and social media posts are a lot more blurred. I wonder if they'll ever be a fourth generation - What will make it distinct from the third? When will it begin?

# Week 2: Lani vs Glitch
<p>
This week, we began coding in Glitch - I was correct in assuming that it would be a learning curve! For the coding playground we're working on, I chose to theme mine after the Taylor Swift 'Lover' album, mostly for the colour scheme. As a romance writer that happens to be single, I tend to project that interest and desire for love into my writing, so 'Lovergirl' is kind about the reality of doing that. Kind of deep for a small practice task, but most of the writing we were supposed to include was supposed to be from text messages and notes app documents that we already have on our phones, so my options were limited - it was either 'dad can you please pick me up from the station?' or love.
My focus tends to be all over the place, so I was surprised how absorbed I was in coding during these lessons. I was pretty determined to wrap my head around what I ws doing, so I ended up getting really invested in finishing it during class and zoned out. Whoops! The coding did break my brain a little as predicted, and it took some time outside of class to catch up, but I managed to fix up any syntax errors without too much of a hitch #improvement

# Week 3: Lani vs Glitch + Github - Round 2 
<p>
Coding playground is just about done! I really enjoyed the search engine task specifically, I was able to put the most ammount of little easter eggs in there, (my favourite things, future aspirations, celebrity crushes, etc.) and felt as though it fit the theme I wanted for my poem the best, its super fun and personalised to me. 
We also moved on to some writing exercises -

# Week 4: Github: 1 Lani: 0
<p>
We were introduced to Twine today, which I like a lot more than Glitch and Github. Until this point I've been writing my weekly reflections in OneNote so I can just put it into my github repository later, but I've decided that I'm now brave enough to step out of my comfort zone and type here instead. As much beef between me and github as there is, it's not actually that bad at all. Funnily enough, a lot of the coding reminds me of minecraft. I've been getting into playing it again recently for the first time since lockdown and there's a command function which uses its own syntax. (for example, /tp @player 12 -34 567 teleports you around the map, /locate biome minecraft:spruce_forest gives you co-ordinates to the nearest forest, you can use the command /give @player minecraft:diamond_sword 1 to give yourself items etc.) I've found it easy to memorise THAT kind of coding language, so it's probably more of a confidence thing over my own capability. 
Anyway, I found Twine's interface was super fun. I have been studying a hypertext built in the same program for my presentation next week, so it was cool to see how that worked. Uploading it to my github repository was the hardest part, it took teacher assistance and about 9 of my previously healthy brain cells, but we got there in the end.

# Week 5: Presentation
<p>
*Requirement for final folio - 350-500 words on the below (this can be done any time this week)
This week's Required Reading (Aarseth 1997) unpacks some territory that speak directly to some of the great questions raised in your Case Study presnetations such as "in what sense can a hypertext be a narrative? Is hypertext a literary genre or a literary technique?" It introduces the important concept of "ergotics": "hypertext is not a reconfiguration of narrative but offers an alternative to it, as I try to demonstrate through the concept of ergodics." (p.95)
What do you think of Aarseth's concept? explain how it offer an alternative to conventional ideas of narrative and the role of reader and writer?
Assessment week! Ahh!
