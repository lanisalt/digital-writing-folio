# Week 1: initial thoughts on the first class
<p>
Coding has always messed with my brain in the same way that maths always has, so I'm going into this class with an open mind, ready to embrace what I'm sure will be a learning curve. Luckily, as a writer, language is what my entire field is built around. I've been taught to adapt it and work with it, bend it to my will as a tangible way to express my thoughts. Coding is nothing more than another medium to for me to play and experiment with, so i'm excited to see where my creativity will lead me. I figured that the digital world is always evolving, so my practice should, too.
