# Exercises
## Week 1 - Hello world!
<p>
Coding has always messed with my brain in the same way that maths always has, so I'm going into this class with an open mind, ready to embrace what I'm sure will be a learning curve. Luckily, as a writer, language is what my entire field is built around. I've been taught to adapt it and work with it, bend it to my will as a tangible way to express my thoughts. Coding is nothing more than another medium to for me to play and experiment with, so i'm excited to see where my creativity will lead me. I figured that the digital world is always evolving, so my practice should, too. 
This week, we discussed the basics of Electronic Literature (or E-lit) and its three generations. The first generatiom (mostly hypertext) and ended in 1995 as the internet continued to expand, allowing for multi-modal E-Lit, (encluding pictures, audio, video, etc,) defining the second generation. Today, in the third generation, pretty much everything is digital, so the lines between games, e-lit and social media posts are a lot more blurred. I wonder when and if they'll ever be a fourth generation - What will make it distinct from the third?

## Week 2: Coding playground

</p>

<p>
This week, we began coding in Glitch - I was correct in assuming that it would be a learning curve! For the coding playground we're working on, a lot of the content we included was stuff that we had already written. I decided to theme my coding playground around Taylor Swift's 2019 album 'Lover', as It started to feel a lot like a personal anthology of mundane, ordinary expressions of my own experiences with different types of love (romantic, family, personal, etc.) through notes app entries, search history and messages. I liked this concept a lot, but executing it in a new medium was tricky and hard to wrap my head around at first. Eventually, however, I managed to smooth out the syntax errors and difficulties I was having, and it coding slowly became a little less intimidating the more I got used to the language and learnt to navigate the lines of code. My favourite part of this exercise was the Google search option, as I was able to sneak in some easter eggs about my interests, the things I love, etc. In a really straightforward, but also hidden way.

# Week 3: Digital poetry
<p>

</p>

<p>
Poetry, (like digital writing, i've found,) is hard to define. I always thought of poetry as short but complex pieces of text that really take a lot of effort to read and even more effort to write. Sometimes poems rhyme, other times they have a certain amount of syllables in each line, and sometimes they're just

  than they actually are

<p>
It was under my impression that the defining factor of a poem would just be the intention behind it - if you write it as a poem, its a poem. So when we learnt about dadaist poems this week, I was confused about what made them poetry. There's a little bit of intention, but there isn't much writing involved at all, as the point is to take something that already exists and make something new out of it. I naturally supposed that meant that the poetic element of it wasn't the writing itself, then, it was the method behind a dadaist poem - meiticulously cutting an article or piece of writing up, shaking them and laying them out to make it your own - that makes it poetic. What confused me, though, was whether copy-pasting a piece of text into a box and clicking a button counted as the same thing, as it takes a lot less effort and dedication than the traditional method. (Turns out this is actually on brand when you look at the anti-art roots of dadaism. it's a double dada, if you will.) Eventually I came to the conclusion that, duh (da), the whole point was that you can still create poetry and find meaning in nonsense without any skill or formal training. It's quite literally the modern art of poetry, (with my personal preferences towards their more traditonal counterparts to boot.)

# Week 4: Experimenting with Twine
<p>
https://github.com/lanisalt/twine-test
</p>

<p>
We were introduced to Twine today, which I like a lot more than Glitch and Github. (Until this point I've been avoiding github, writing my weekly reflections in OneNote so I can just put it into my repository later, but I've decided that I'm now brave enough to step out of my comfort zone and type here instead.) 
</p>

<p>
I found that I enjoyed using Twine's interface much more than Glitch and Github, as some of the coding reminds me of Discord chat shortcuts and Minecraft commands, which both have syntaxes that were easy enough for me to memorise back in my 'gamer girl' phase of 2020-2022. It's also a lot less intimidating than straight javascript, with the little boxes helping visualise what elements the different parts of code work with what, and how they connect to eachother and work together. I might look into working with twine for my final assignment, as the typertext I have been studying for my presentation next week was written in the same program. Funnily enough, the hardest part of this activity for me was uploading my work to my Github repository, (which does not surprise me. I've had constant beef with this website since day one.) It took teacher assistance and about 9 of my previously healthy brain cells, but we got there in the end. I just need to figure out how to get my images to show up, and we're set.
</p>

# Week 5: Presentation
<p>
*Requirement for final folio - 350-500 words on the below (this can be done any time this week)
This week's Required Reading (Aarseth 1997) unpacks some territory that speak directly to some of the great questions raised in your Case Study presnetations such as "in what sense can a hypertext be a narrative? Is hypertext a literary genre or a literary technique?" It introduces the important concept of "ergotics": "hypertext is not a reconfiguration of narrative but offers an alternative to it, as I try to demonstrate through the concept of ergodics." (p.95) What do you think of Aarseth's concept? explain how it offer an alternative to conventional ideas of narrative and the role of reader and writer?
</p>

# Week 6: Twine pt. 2
<p>
https://github.com/lanisalt/image-map-test
</p>

<p>
We worked on image styling, audio and image maps this week. My favourite part was the image map, specifically, which I think i'll be using as the main component of my final project.
</p>

# Week 8: Author Website
<p>
https://github.com/lanisalt/author-website
</p>

<p>
Making an author website was a really useful skill to learn - in this industry, you very much have to rely on yourself to promote your work and create connections with other writers, editors, potential clients, etc. which i've come to realise more as I get closer to finishing this course, (we are under the media and communications school, after all!) Luckily, with social media it has become a lot easier to make these connections, and having a website means your work and contact info is right there is a bonus in case anyone wants to access it. I would like to put my work somewhere easily accessible on the internet, so I tried to include links to some of my work that I've published on Portfolium, as well as some cute picture-book-like drawings i've done over the years just for fun. It's not fully functional yet, but I have enough basics down to know how to create my own website, which is super cool and a valueable skill to have, considering how much it normally costs to have someone make and operate a website for you , (speaking from experience, with my dad once working as a freelance graphic/web designer and my mum in marketing.)
