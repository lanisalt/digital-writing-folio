# Week 1: initial thoughts on the first class
<p>
Coding has always messed with my brain in the same way that maths always has, so going into this class, I'm a little sceptical about how i'll do. However, there's a learning curve to everything and I hope that merging it with something i love and understand (writing) will help.
